### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
-   Iâ€™m currently learning C,C++.
-   I've got a decent handle on: javascript (vanilla, react, node), php, python, bash, sql
-   I can get by on: java, c#, vba, foxpro, typescript
-   I have eclectic knowledge base, with a lot of specilization in production (film/theater/factory/music/art)
-   I learn quickly - my media choices mostly consist of tutorial / math / informational content.
-   I spend a lot of time just pondering things: which make for great medium talk, and terrible small talk.
-   I want to use my skills to make the world a better place: what I'm working on, or who I'm working for is more important than if I work at all.
